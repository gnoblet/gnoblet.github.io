# Introduction to Quarto

Quarto is a multi-language, next-generation version of R Markdown from RStudio, built on Pandoc.

## Code Example

Here's a simple code example in R:

```{r}
#| label: simple-plot
#| fig-cap: "A simple scatter plot with regression line"
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

# Create some sample data
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),
  y = rnorm(100)
)

# Create a scatter plot with regression line
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Sample Scatter Plot",
       x = "X Variable",
       y = "Y Variable")
```

## Math Support

Quarto also supports LaTeX equations:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi x} d\xi
$$

## Interactive Features

Quarto enables interactive visualizations and applications with various JavaScript libraries.

## Conclusion

Quarto provides a unified authoring framework for data science, combining computation, visualization, and text.
