# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog built with React and Markdown!

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted to share my thoughts and experiences with:

- Web development
- React best practices
- Learning new technologies

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them!
