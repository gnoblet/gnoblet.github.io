# Hey👋, i'm Guillaume, exploring switching to a data journalist career

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m a humanitarian researcher who thrives where academic curiosity meets real-world impact. Whether wrangling massive datasets from crisis zones or debating the finer points of economic history, I love turning complex problems into actionable insights—and having a bit of fun along the way.

## What I Do

Currently, I’m the Research Manager for the Global Research & Development team at IMPACT Initiatives in Geneva. My team and I orchestrate Multi-Sector Needs Assessments (MSNAs)—think nationwide surveys in over 20 countries, designed to inform humanitarian action where it matters most. I get to:

- Dive into data from around the globe and build composite indicators that help shape humanitarian funding.
- Champion best practices in research design, from sampling to analysis, and coordinate a squad of specialists to keep our methods sharp.
- Liaise with country teams and foreign offices to make sure our research translates into real-world change.

Before Geneva, I led the MSNA in Haiti, managing a team of 80+ and co-chairing the Information Management Working Group to improve the humanitarian information landscape. In Burkina Faso, I managed data and GIS teams, led field research, and collaborated with ministries, UN agencies, and coordination bodies

## Academic Adventures

I hold a fully funded doctorate in economics from the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, where I explored the history of agricultural economics in the interwar United States. My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including:

“The Making of a Science of Agricultural Economics in the Interwar United States: Methods, Experiments, and Statistics” (Œconomia, 2021)

“The Emergence of Agricultural Economics as a Discipline in the United States” (Revue d’Histoire des Sciences Humaines, 2020)

I’ve also coordinated research networks, organized seminars, and taught mathematics and economic analysis to undergrads and grads.
